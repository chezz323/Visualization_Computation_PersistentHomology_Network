# Visualization and Computation of Persistent Homology of Network Data

## Introduction
 The network is becoming more and more important for studying our lives. There exist a lot of networks such as the Internet, social networks, biological networks and so on. Analyzing network is crucial to capture the complex relationships, however, classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on differences between node or edge measurements without considering the topological features such as connected components or holes. Also, when data has a high dimension, it is hard to analyze data just looking at numerous rows and columns. Visualization network is one of the easiest methods to understand these data. By visualizing it, we can grasp the structure of data, and connectivity of each node. A persistent homology is a mathematical tool in computational topology. Computation the persistent homology reveals topological features of the network such as shapes and Betti numbers as well. The problem is, how to visualize the network with understandable and how to measure the distance between edges when Euclidean distance is not adaptable. In this project, I studied visualization and analysis topological features of the network data using the weight of the edge. Analyzing weighted network is useful when we consider the real-world network because weight between nodes implies the significance so find persistence homology with filtration by weight will give useful topological features in many situations.
 
 ## Dataset
 The data set used in this project is provided from Stack Overflow, retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-tag-network, which is a network data of technology tags on the Stack Overflow online developer community website. The data can be accessed freely at \cite{stack}. Nowadays, there are myriad technologies we are using, which are related to each other. Therefore, it is time-consuming to think which are related to certain technology. One way to get relationships among them is by analyzing tag correlations among them. There are two files, `stack_network_nodes.csv` is set of all nodes and its information of node size and group. The group indicates cluster calculated by walktrap, and a node size implies how often it used. `stack_network_links.csv` include information of every edge and its weight. (See. Table 2, 3) The data consists of 115 number of nodes and 290 number of edges. Weight is important in this project because it will be used as filtration when computing persistent homology.
